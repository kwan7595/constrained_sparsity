# Velocity Constrained Optimization Based Neural Network Pruning

## Project Description
This project explores a preliminary, simple, and principled approach to neural network pruning during training. It focuses on achieving exact sparsity in a projection-free manner, using velocity-constrained optimization methods.

## Prerequisites
- Install the necessary dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install cooper
  ```

## Installation Instructions
- Make sure the project is configured based on the provided `mypy.ini` file.
